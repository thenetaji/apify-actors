# Website Media Link Scraper

Extract media content from any website fast. Find videos, images, and audio files hiding in web pages with a lightweight, efficient crawler that won't hog your resources.

## What it does

This actor scans websites to extract media links embedded within pages. Unlike browser-based scrapers, it uses lightweight HTTP requests to quickly discover and catalog media content across entire domains.

**Perfect for:**
- Content creators looking for media resources
- Researchers collecting media samples
- SEO specialists analyzing media usage
- Web developers auditing media assets

## How it works

1. **Enter a starting URL** - Point the scraper to your target website
2. **Choose scanning options** - Set crawl depth, link patterns, and media types
3. **Let it run** - The scraper finds all embedded media links
4. **Export the results** - Get a clean dataset of all discovered media

The actor intelligently follows links while identifying videos, images, audio files, and other media content embedded in HTML and JavaScript.
