# Video Download Link Crawler

Discover and extract direct video download links from websites without the resource overhead of browser-based solutions.

## Why use this crawler?

Finding videos across websites can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This actor automates the process using lightweight HTTP requests to identify and extract video links efficiently.

**Ideal for:**
- Digital marketers collecting video content
- Content researchers finding multimedia resources
- Developers building media aggregation tools
- Anyone needing to catalog videos across websites

## Core functionality

1. **Target your sources** - Add starting URLs where you want to find videos
2. **Set crawl parameters** - Configure depth and page limits
3. **Run the crawler** - Let it discover embedded and downloadable videos
4. **Collect the links** - Get a comprehensive dataset of all discovered videos

The crawler intelligently follows links while identifying videos embedded in HTML and JavaScript.
